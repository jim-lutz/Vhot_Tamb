    recover software to digitize Meyer paper graphs
    looking for L/p-d by month for houses, townhouses and apartments

    see get_townhouse.sh to extract high density tiff files

    for digitizing
    https://github.com/markummitchell/engauge-digitizer
    
    there's a flatpak

    copy get_townhouse.sh and modify to get_houses.sh and get_apartments.sh
    that worked
    
    redo get_apartments.sh fix file name
    
    enguage help see
    https://digitizer.sourceforge.net/usermanual/index.html
    
    may help enguage if image is only the grid, not numbers or labels
    no that didn't work
    
    did point fitting
    see apartments.csv  high-density-houses.csv  houses.csv  townhouses.csv
    
    have 9 curves to fit
    probably best to use R for consistency
    
    the *.csv files sometimes have multiple x values, and multiple y values as well
    not sure I can tell which ones were the ones I selected, and which were extrapolated by engauge
    maybe add in high-density-houses.csv to the houses.csv
    
    need to put the Johannesburg Tamb data in a csv as well
    
    then plot each of the 9 curves {apartements, townhouses, houses} X { low-density, medium-density, high-density}
    of Vhot vs Tamb
    
    do a linear fit for each
    then maybe look at the multiple points,
    
    start a git/Rproj here
    see 15 New project, GitHub first
    15.2.2 RStudio IDE
    https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first#rstudio-ide
    In RStudio, start a new Project:    
    
    had to move Vhot_Tamb to Vhot_Tamb.tmp
    to make Vhot_Tamb a git project directory
    don't move the existing data and graphics shells to avoid breaking current scripts
    
    copy startup.R from /home/jiml/HotWaterResearch/projects/2023 SA WH/SA_WH_geyser_standby_loss
    for easy consistent startup
    
    and .gitignore
    
    looks like should read in  each csv then transform to long
    want the data.table elements to be:
        month  # starts out as x, needs to be rounded to nearest integer
        dwelling    # high-density-townhouses,low-density-townhouses,medium-density-townhouses, etc
                    is the columns names in the csv files
        X       # decimal month of year from digitizing
        Vhot  # l/p-d, these are the values in the fields
